# Glayout-Based-Folded-Cascode
This work aims for semi-automatic layout generation, developed in Python and built on the GLayout framework. The approach requires initial manual step to define parameterized functions for a given circuit, after which multiple layouts can be automatically generated by adjusting design parameters such as transistor sizes and placement matrices.
